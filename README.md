# Github Star Tagger

A web app that allows you to tag your Github stars, thereby making it easier to find the correct project for the task at hand.
It also lets you search your stars by project description as well as name, filter by language and order by star age or name.

As the app stores all its data in localStorage, you can just use it from http://ockle.github.io/github-star-tagger/

However, if you do want to run the app from elsewhere:

### Installation

1. `bower install`
2. `npm install`
3. `grunt install`

There's a `--dir` option on `grunt install` the lets you set the directory the app will install into, defaulting to `public`.
